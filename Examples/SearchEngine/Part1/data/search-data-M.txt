Concordat of Worms
concordat
of
worms
sometimes
called
the
pactum
calixtinum
by
papal
historians
was
an
agreement
between
pope
calixtusii
and
holy
roman
emperor
henryv
on
september
near
the
city
of
worms
it
brought
to
an
end
the
first
phase
of
the
power
struggle
between
the
papacy
and
the
holy
roman
emperors
and
has
been
interpreted
as
containing
within
itself
the
germ
of
nationbased
sovereignty
that
would
one
day
be
confirmed
in
the
treaty
of
westphalia
in
part
this
was
an
unforeseen
result
of
strategic
maneuvering
between
the
church
and
the
european
sovereigns
over
political
control
within
their
domains
the
king
was
recognised
as
having
the
right
to
invest
bishops
with
secular
authority
by
the
lance
in
the
territories
they
governed
but
not
with
sacred
authority
by
ring
and
staff
the
result
was
that
bishops
owed
allegiance
in
worldly
matters
both
to
the
pope
and
to
the
king
for
they
were
obligated
to
affirm
the
right
of
the
sovereign
to
call
upon
them
for
military
support
under
his
oath
of
fealty
previous
holy
roman
emperors
had
thought
it
their
right
granted
by
god
to
name
church
officials
within
their
territories
such
as
bishops
and
to
confirm
the
papal
election
and
at
times
of
extraordinary
urgency
actually
name
popes
in
fact
the
emperors
had
been
heavily
relying
on
bishops
for
their
secular
administration
as
they
were
not
hereditary
or
quasihereditary
nobility
with
family
interests
thus
adding
further
suspense
to
the
struggle
a
more
immediate
result
of
the
investiture
struggle
identified
a
proprietary
right
that
adhered
to
sovereign
territory
recognising
the
right
of
kings
to
income
from
the
territory
of
a
vacant
diocese
and
a
basis
for
justifiable
taxation
these
rights
lay
outside
feudalism
which
defined
authority
in
a
hierarchy
of
personal
relations
with
only
a
loose
relation
to
territory
the
pope
emerged
as
a
figure
above

out

Utilitarianism
utilitarianism
is
a
theory
in
normative
ethics
holding
that
the
best
moral
action
is
the
one
that
maximizes
utility
utility
is
defined
in
various
ways
but
is
usually
related
to
the
wellbeing
of
sentient
entities
originally
jeremy
bentham
the
founder
of
utilitarianism
defined
utility
as
the
aggregate
pleasure
after
deducting
suffering
of
all
involved
in
any
action
john
stuart
mill
expanded
this
concept
of
utility
to
include
not
only
the
quantity
but
quality
of
pleasure
while
focusing
on
rules
instead
of
individual
moral
actions
others
have
rejected
that
pleasure
has
positive
value
and
have
advocated
negative
utilitarianism
which
defines
utility
only
in
terms
of
suffering
as
opposed
to
this
hedonistic
view
some
define
utility
with

are
mobile
land
weapon
platforms
mounting
a

cannon
in

this
with
heavy
vehicle
armour
which
provides
protection
for
the
crew
the
vehicles
weapons
and
its
propulsion
systems

operational
mobility
due

ore
this

production
of

metals
from

smelting
makes
use

a

reducing
agent
to
decompose
the
ore
driving
off
other
elements
as
gases

slag

the
metal
base

the
reducing
agent

commonly
a
source
of
carbon
such

charcoal
the
carbon
or
carbon
monoxide
derived
from
it
removes
oxygen
from

carbon
is
thus
oxidized
in
